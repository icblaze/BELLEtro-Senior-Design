// This class handles the functionality of the delete button, and it handles removing the cards
// from the players hand. This class also retrieves cards from the deck into the empty slots that
// are in the players hand.
// Van Phan(trieu1852000): Implemented the DeleteCard class
// Zacharia Alaoui(ZachariaAlaoui): Added comments throughout the class for better readibility
